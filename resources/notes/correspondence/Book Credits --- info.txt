### Dedication Page Note:

Without having to print their actual DNA sequences here... This work is especially dedicated to those blessed 3 souls that keep their father's genuine genetic code alive...  Arora J. Muntu, the jolly observant fellow, Theo R. Willrich, the one that knows to bring true numbers to life, and our only daughter, Shona K. Marlyn, the loyal keeper of all our special sequences. Without them, I trust that this book would not have advanced past the front cover.

And that in exercising our will we might become aware of the divine in us and thus make glory manifest. God is not asleep in us!

Add this line somewhere in your document:
```latex
\showthe\font
```
Then compile with `latex` or `pdfLaTeX` (not XeLaTeX). It will output the font info to the **log file**, not the PDF.

You’ll see something like:
```
> \font=cmr10 at 10.0pt.
```
Which means you're using **Computer Modern Roman 10pt**.
