Here we see the first successful harvest of a pineapple from our home garden. But also, this case inspired part of the discussion in \textbf {Chapter \ref {SEC4}} about how in real genome expression systems, the organism expressed from genetic code somewhat still includes the genetic code in the manifested organism as some kind of prefix (in leaves for example) or suffix (roots), from which the original organism can still be later reproduced!}}{3}{figure.caption.6}%
